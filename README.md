# HashingAssignment
A hashing assignment from Grade 12 Computer Science!  This was one of my more involved projects from high school, as we had to generate the hash key and sort the values accordingly.  There were a lot of conditions that we had to check and account for, but this assignment was a lot of fun regardless! (if you can't tell by these projects, I really liked high school CS and would highly recommend it!)

Made with IntelliJ IDEA and Java 18
